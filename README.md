#### Running the Application

## Development Environment

- Make sure the following network ports are not in use since the following services will be running from the container

  - 8080: phpmyadmin
  - 8081: server app
  - 3000: client app

- To build/rebuild the image (do this initially and whenever new node modules are installed)

Stop the containers if they are currently running

```
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

```
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
```

- To run a container from the image built

```
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
``

<!--
- To rebuild and run (in case the compose file was edited) use --force-recreate flag

```

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --force-recreate

```-->

- Use Ctrl+C to stop all services or,
```

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml stop
